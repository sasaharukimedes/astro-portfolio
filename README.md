# Digest

このポートフォリオは Astro で制作しています。簡単な hmtl だけでも書くことが出来、ReactやSvelteなどで書くこともできるということで、汎用性や書きやすさの観点で採用しました。これまでの経歴や、制作物などがわかりやすくまとめられているポートフォリオを目指して開発しており、適宜書き直していく予定です。ですので、トップ画面ももしかしたら大きく変更されているかもしれません。

### English Below

This portfolio was created in Astro. It was chosen for its versatility and ease of writing, as it can be written using only simple hmtl and can also be written in React, Svelte, etc. We are developing this site with the aim of creating a portfolio that clearly summarizes our past history and productions, and we plan to rewrite it as needed. Therefore, the top screen may possibly be changed significantly.

## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
├── public/
│   └── favicon.svg
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   └── Card.astro
│   ├── layouts/
│   │   └── Layout.astro
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
